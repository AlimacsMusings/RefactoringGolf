# RefactoringGolf
Refactoring Golf Exercise (inspired by Dave Cleal, Ivan Moore and Mike Hill)

## Instructions
Your goal is to safely and efficiently as possible refactor the HoleXBefore code to look like the HoleXAfter code. 

You must aim to do it in as few "strokes" as possible.

A "stroke" is essentially a change made to the code, and every stroke costs you points.

Your pairing partner should carefully score you as follows:

- 1 point for every change made to the code using a shortcut or automated IDE feature (e.g., an automated refactoring, code template, or Find/Replace)

- 2 points for every manual edit. Note that a single "edit" could cover multiple lines of code.

- Zero points for code formatting (e.g., deleting whitespace or optimizing imports).

Allow yourselves a maximum of 2 attempts at each round to determine your best score
